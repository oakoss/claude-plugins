## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Renamed the main action skill from `cycle` to `review` to align with the Anthropic convention used by `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` and improve discoverability in the `/` autocomplete. Invocation changed from `/review-cycle:cycle` to `/review-cycle:review`. All hook directives, documentation, and policy references updated accordingly.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Initial release.
- `/review-cycle:cycle` skill — full automated review loop with parallel Codex + pr-review-toolkit fan-out, fix-vs-defer policy, up to 4 iterations, and final de-slopify cleanup.
- `/review-cycle:inspect` skill — read-only inspection pass for sanity checks or pre-commit review.
- SessionStart hook to seed the per-project review sentinel idempotently on fresh session starts.
- Stop hook to gate turn-end on uncommitted-and-unreviewed changes.
- PreToolUse (Bash) hook to block `git commit` when the sentinel doesn't match the current state.
- Per-project opt-out via `.claude/.no-review-gate` and global kill-switch via `~/.claude/.disable-review-gate`.
- Embedded comment and fix-vs-defer policies inside the skills, with standalone copies in `reference/policies.md` for optional CLAUDE.md installation.
